% This is the main loop for navigation. It utlizes receiver observables, satellite
% specific information, correction information, and offers a navigation
% solution based on the user configuration settings
%
% Inputs:
%   obsData         - structure with observations for all measurement epochs
%   allSettings     - configuration parameters
%   ephData         - ephemeris data for all systems
%
% Outputs:
%   obsData         - strcture with observations for all measurement epochs
%   satData         - structure with satellite info for all epochs
%   navData         - Navigation solution for all epochs
